# DIWAN
Distributed IoT based Water Analytics Network

## Description 

Millions of liters of water is being wasted every day and there are no regulations or policies taking actions to reduce the
same.There is no comprehensive system in place
Millions of urban inhabitants will be benefit from DIWAN, People will now be able to quantify and visualize their water
usage in real-time and reap benefits from the system by using water judiciously.
DIWAN brings water usage data to your fingertips - It is a Distributed IoT based Water Analytics Network which consists ofa network of IoT devices that collect water usage data of urban households. Each device tracks the volume of water
drawn from the source and the water level of the source.
DIWAN uses a distributed IoT network, making it very scalable. The data can be used by residents and policy makers alike
to mitigate wastage and devise better water management techniques.The individual units use solar power, will cost less
than $10 and will work anywhere with an internet connection.
